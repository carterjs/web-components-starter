# Web Components Starter

A starting point for apps built with Web Components using Lit Element, TypeScript, Sass, and Webpack.

## Workflow

Start the development server with the ```npm start``` command. The server will hot-reload for changes made within the "src" directory, but not for changes to the configuration files (including the Webpack and TypeScript configutations)

Build the project with ```npm run build```. The built project is put into the "dist" directory. Building is a relatively slow process and it will only get slower as the project grows. It is recommended that you do this only when checking the structure or deploying the app.
